# Stage 1: Idea capture

## Purpose
Capture raw thinking in a way that can be structured and reused across formats later.

## Inputs
- Notes
- Voice notes
- Meeting transcripts
- Rough briefs
- Bullet points

## Outputs
- A single source document that defines:
  - Audience
  - Intent
  - Core message
  - Constraints

## Practical steps
1. Capture all raw material in one place
2. Define the audience and intended outcome
3. Reduce the idea to 3 to 5 core points
4. Note tone, format, length, and compliance constraints
5. Decide what “done” looks like

## Common failure modes
- Ideas spread across multiple tools
- No audience defined
- No clear outcome or use case
