# Stage 4: Translation and localisation

## Purpose
Adapt content so it is accurate, natural, and appropriate for different languages and regions.

## Inputs
- Approved source content
- Target languages and regions
- Terminology or style guidance
- Compliance or legal constraints

## Outputs
- Localised versions that preserve meaning, tone, and intent
- Region-appropriate terminology and phrasing

## Practical steps
1. Translate meaning, not words
2. Adapt phrasing for regional norms and expectations
3. Check terminology consistency
4. Review names, numbers, and claims
5. Validate tone and clarity with a human review step

## Common failure modes
- Literal translations that sound unnatural
- Inconsistent terminology across languages
- Skipping review for regulated or sensitive content
